    <h1>Linux Lab 5: Regular Expressions</h1>
    <p>
        This lab will give you some experience working with regular expressions.
        These are useful not just in the terminal, when working with commands like <code>grep</code>, but in other programming languages like Python, and PHP, whenever searching through text must be done.
    </p>
    <h3>Assignment</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Visit <a href="https://regexone.com/">https://regexone.com/</a>.</li>
        <li>Complete Lessons 1 through 15 of the Interactive Tutorial.</li>
        <li>Complete Practice Problems 1-6.</li>
        <li>Place each of your regular expressions into the quotes in the return statement of each Python function in the starter code. E.g., for exercise 1, the starter code looks like:
        <div style="margin-left:50px;">
<pre><span style="color:#2e8b57; font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#00008f">exercise1</span><span style="color:#676767">():</span>
    <span style="color:#2929cc"># 1. Matching Decimal Numbers:</span>
    <span style="color:#2e8b57; font-weight:bold">return</span> <span style="color:#ff1493">&quot;&quot;</span> <span style="color:#2929cc"># place your pattern in these quotes</span>
</pre>
</div>        Once you have tested your expression through RegexOne, place your expression inside the quotes. Do this for the first 6 exercises. (I encourage you to practice by completing 7 and 8 too, but these are not graded.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Submit your filled-out starter code to Moodle.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Submission</h3>
    <p>
        For this assignment, you only need to submit solutions for practice problems 1-6.
        When you do, place your patterns in the quotes in the appropriately named function inside the starter code, then remove any unused functions, and submit to Moodle.
