    Returns a string suitable to write to a vpl_evaluate.cases file
    to invoke a single test method from a VPLTestCase.
    Accepts a tuple containing the names of the 
    - test_module, 
    - test_class, and 
    - test_method,
    in that order.

    NOTE: test_module should consist ONLY of a single directory. 
    Multiple nested directories must not be used when publishing to VPL. 
    
    For instance: Suppose your directory structure looks like this:
    my_cs_class/
     |- __init__.py
     |- Labs/
     |   |- __init__.py
     |   |- Lab1/
     |   |   |- __init__.py
     |   |   |- test_lab1.py
     |   |   └- lab1_key.py
     |   └- Lab2/
     |       |- __init__.py
     |       |- test_lab2.py
     |       └- lab2_key.py
     └- Notes/
         |- notes.tex
         └- notes.pdf
    
    The __init__.py files are present at each level so that each directory becomes an importable 
    Python module, enabling unittest to find and run all test automatically. However, this means 
    that test_module will have a different value when test modules are run this way, than it would
    have when tests modules are run singly. In the former, the entire path is included:

    Labs.Lab06_SQL_Queries_1.01_all_owners.test_all_owners.TestOwnerNames.testSelectAllOwners
    
    and in the latter, only the directory directly containing the individual test method is included:

    test_all_owners.TestOwnerNames.testSelectAllOwners

    We make the assumption that the lowest subdirectories in a hierarchy are each meant to become
    a VPL module on Moodle. For this reason, we strip all but the last submodule name, so that test 
    methods are referred to by a name which will let VPL find them, instead of using the extra 
    prefixes which will not be available to VPL at runtime.
